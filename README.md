Tibetan singing bowls ... with Javascript!

iBowls is an experiment on chromotherapy and tibetan singing bowls with javascript.

# Motivation
A study on javascript capabilities by using the Canvas object alongside the p5 library, 
the inspiration for it was to build a website where people could just come in, relax and heal for a nice moment, 
besides trying to understand where can we go creatively with javascript by using canvas and webaudio.

# Processing
The project is using processing JS brother, namely p5

 * http://p5js.org/

# Building
Feel free to fork it and play around with the code, I've tried hard to document everything to be really 
easy for anyone to understand it and modify it.

I'm using Grunt for the build process, just run the single task to have a build artifact inside dist/ folder:

 * grunt build
